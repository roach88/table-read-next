# Product Requirements Document (PRD) â€“ Table Read

## Purpose
Table Read is a modern, accessible web application for collaborative script reading. It empowers writers, actors, and creative teams to conduct remote or in-person table reads efficiently, with a beautiful, accessible UI and high-quality voice synthesis.

## Problems to Solve
- Difficulty collaborating on scripts remotely or asynchronously
- Lack of accessible, user-friendly tools for script reading/playback
- Manual, error-prone script sharing/editing workflows
- Limited options for high-quality voice playback of scripts

## User Stories
1. As a user, I can sign up and authenticate securely.
2. As a user, I can upload scripts in Final Draft, text, PDF, HTML, or RTF formats.
3. As a user, I can flag uploads as scripts for special features.
4. As a user, I can view, edit, and organize my scripts in a clean UI.
5. As a user, I can assign parts/roles and collaborate in real time or asynchronously.
6. As a user, I can play back scripts using high-quality text-to-speech (TTS).
7. As a user, I can access all features with keyboard and screen reader support.
8. As a user, I receive clear feedback and error messages throughout the app.
