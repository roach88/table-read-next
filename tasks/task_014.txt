# Task ID: 14
# Title: Performance Optimization
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 7, 9, 10
# Priority: medium
# Description: Optimize the application for performance, including load times, rendering, and API calls.
# Details:
1. Implement code splitting and lazy loading
2. Optimize asset loading (images, fonts, etc.)
3. Add caching strategies for API responses
4. Implement virtualization for long lists
5. Optimize rendering performance (memoization, etc.)
6. Add prefetching for common navigation paths
7. Optimize database queries
8. Implement service worker for offline support
9. Set up performance monitoring

# Test Strategy:
Measure and compare load times before and after optimization. Test with performance profiling tools. Verify that large scripts load and render efficiently. Test with slow network conditions. Measure Time to Interactive and other key metrics.
