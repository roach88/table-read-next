# Task ID: 3
# Title: Supabase Storage and Database Setup
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Configure Supabase storage for script uploads and create the necessary database tables with Row Level Security (RLS) policies.
# Details:
1. Create a `documents` table in Supabase with fields for metadata (title, type, owner, created_at, updated_at, etc.)
2. Set up Supabase storage buckets for script files
3. Implement Row Level Security (RLS) policies to ensure users can only access their own documents
4. Create database indexes for efficient queries
5. Set up database triggers for any automated actions
6. Create API functions to interact with storage and database
7. Implement error handling for database operations

# Test Strategy:
Test CRUD operations on the database. Verify that RLS policies correctly restrict access to documents. Test file upload, retrieval, and deletion from storage. Ensure proper error handling for database and storage operations.
