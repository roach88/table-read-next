# Priority: high
# Description: Integrate ElevenLabs Text-to-Speech API for high-quality script playback with character voice assignment.
# Details:
1. Set up ElevenLabs API client
2. Create voice selection interface for characters
3. Implement text chunking for API limits
4. Add caching for generated audio to reduce API calls
5. Create audio playback controls (play, pause, skip, speed)
6. Implement audio streaming for long scripts
7. Add progress indicators during TTS generation
8. Create fallback for API failures
9. Implement voice customization options

# Test Strategy:
Test TTS generation with various script lengths and formats. Verify audio playback controls work correctly. Test caching mechanism. Verify streaming works for long scripts. Test error handling when API is unavailable.
