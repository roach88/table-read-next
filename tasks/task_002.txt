# Task ID: 2
# Title: Supabase Integration for Authentication
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement user authentication using Supabase, including sign up, sign in, password reset, and session management.
# Details:
1. Set up Supabase project and configure authentication providers
2. Create authentication hooks for sign up, sign in, sign out, and password reset
3. Implement protected routes and authentication guards
4. Create user profile database schema
5. Design and implement authentication UI components (sign up, login forms)
6. Add session persistence and token refresh logic
7. Implement error handling for authentication flows

# Test Strategy:
Test user registration, login, logout, and password reset flows. Verify that protected routes are inaccessible without authentication. Test token refresh and session persistence across page reloads.
