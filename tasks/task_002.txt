# Task ID: 2
# Title: Supabase Integration for Authentication
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement user authentication using Supabase, including sign up, sign in, password reset, and session management.
# Details:
1. Supabase project and authentication providers are set up
2. Authentication service layer (`src/services/auth.ts`) and hooks (`src/hooks/useAuth.tsx`) are implemented and verified against Supabase best practices
3. Implementation is modular, type-safe, and follows best practices
4. Next step: build and integrate authentication UI components (sign up, login forms, password reset, etc.)
5. Implement protected routes and authentication guards
6. Create user profile database schema (if needed)
7. Add session persistence and token refresh logic
8. Implement error handling for authentication flows

# Test Strategy:
Test user registration, login, logout, and password reset flows. Verify that protected routes are inaccessible without authentication. Test token refresh and session persistence across page reloads.
