## Current Work Focus

- Implementing authentication UI components (SignIn, SignUp, etc.) using the new Supabase service layer and React hooks
- Integrating authentication flows into the app layout and protected routes
- Continuing to enhance user experience and accessibility

## Recent Changes (May 2025)

- Project setup, formatting, linting, and documentation completed
- New git and GitHub repo initialized for a clean codebase
- Supabase authentication service layer (`src/services/auth.ts`) implemented and aligned with official recommendations
- Custom React context and hook (`src/hooks/useAuth.tsx`) created for global auth state and helpers
- All code is now modular, type-safe, and ready for further feature development

## Next Steps

- Build and integrate authentication UI components (SignIn, SignUp, PasswordReset, etc.)
- Connect UI to hooks and service layer
- Add protected routes and session management
- Continue with collaborative and document management features

## Active Decisions & Considerations

- All architectural and tech stack decisions remain accurate
- Continue to prioritize accessibility, modularity, and type safety
- Documentation and memory-bank are kept up to date with each major change
