- Authentication and upload flows are implemented (Supabase, API route, script checkbox)
- Type augmentation and backend middleware for user auth are set up
- tsconfig and SQL migration updated for new flows
- Supabase Storage RLS policy configured; file upload, list, and cleanup tested and passing with automated Vitest tests
- ElevenLabs TTS integration implemented with Cloudflare-compatible APIs
- Document management fully integrated with Supabase
- Frontend document upload, listing, and refresh functionality working
- Interactive script mode with synchronized text highlighting
- Project setup, linting, formatting, and documentation are complete; repo is on GitHub
- Supabase authentication service layer and React context/hooks are implemented and verified against Supabase best practices

## What's Left to Build

- Script editing and collaborative features
- Further accessibility improvements and end-to-end testing
- Deployment to Cloudflare
