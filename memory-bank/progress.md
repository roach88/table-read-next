## What Works

- Project documentation and protocols are established (memory-bank, .windsurfrules)
- Core project structure and technical stack are defined
- Authentication and upload flows are implemented (Supabase, API route, script checkbox)
- Type augmentation and backend middleware for user auth are set up
- tsconfig and SQL migration updated for new flows
- Supabase Storage RLS policy configured; file upload, list, and cleanup tested and passing with automated Vitest tests
- ElevenLabs TTS integration implemented with Cloudflare-compatible APIs
- Document management fully integrated with Supabase
- Frontend document upload, listing, and refresh functionality working

## What's Left to Build

- Script editing and collaborative features
- Further accessibility improvements and end-to-end testing
- Deployment to Cloudflare
- Mobile responsiveness improvements
- User authentication flow improvements
- Additional voice customization options

## Current Status

- Foundation is set for rapid feature development
- Documentation and architectural patterns are in place
- Core features implemented: file upload, document management, TTS integration, script practice

- Ready for deployment and user testing

## Known Issues

- No major issues at this stage; core functionalities are implemented and working

### May 5, 2025
